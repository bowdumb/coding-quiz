# Timed Quiz

This project was created as a challenge presented during the Georgia Tech edX full-stack coding bootcamp.

The intention of this application was to create a timed quiz that would subtract time from the ticking clock when incorrect answers were submitted. For this particular application I designed a timed quiz featuring questions related to wine and viticulture.

## Installation

This application has been deployed via GitHub Pages, and can be used by following the deployment link within this GitHub repository, or directly through this URL: https://github.com/claxCode/coding-quiz. Additionally, this application may be accessed by downloading the files locally and opening them within VSCode, or equivalent software.

## Functionality

When interacting with this application, the user must first click on the "start" button to initiate the timer at 60 seconds and prompt the display of the first question. The user will then be presented with the current question, as well as four options for answers displayed in the form of buttons. When selecting the correct answer, they will advance to the next question. When presented with incorrect buttons, they will advance to the next question in addition to a 10 second deduction off of the timer. This will repeat until the user has submitted answers for all of the questions, or the timer has reached zero. If the user answers all the questions and has time remaining on the clock, that number is to serve as their score.
